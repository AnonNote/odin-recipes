Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

After the project...

I have learned:
1) To use the VSCode "!" shortcut for HTML
2) To insert links and images in a website
3) To make lists in HTML
